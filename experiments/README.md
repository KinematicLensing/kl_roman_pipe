## Experiments

This is a place to organize and track particular experiments that our team undertakes, with a focus on pipeline testing or prototype measurements.

While we will come up with an official policy later, for now **please do not commit notebooks, particularly ones with images!!**. We cannot easily remove them from the history once added. There are many options available such as `jupyter nbconvert --to python ...` or even internal Jupyter exports in the file manager.
