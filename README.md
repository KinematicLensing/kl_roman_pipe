# kl_roman_test
Test repo to try out a new pipeline approach for Roman KL

NOTE: currently under significant construction. New users should check out the latest branch until things have settled (currently `se/basic_models`)

2) Get `conda-lock` in your base env: `conda install conda-lock`
3) `make install`
